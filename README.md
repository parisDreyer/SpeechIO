# SpeechIO
This is the skeleton of a voice interactive api for use in the Chrome or Microsoft Edge Browser to modify text and code
on your local computer (using the webkit speech recognition api). T
he entrypoint from the program is basic HTML hosted by your browser through a localhost, e.g. python simpleserver
currently the .bat file can be run to open the program (it doesn't do much yet lol)

...
will be adding php request functionality and different local server hosting functionality

will be adding logic for different subroutines, such as "dictate essay" or "search internet database for research question answers"

Will be adding locally installed chatbot to facilitate communication with the api as a secondary module that can be overridden with direct commands


This is the start of a very big project that will probably take a few months to become useful and a few years to become extraordinary
